The authors describe a procedure to adjust the illumination level such that the pupil response is steepest. However, this procedure is based on the pupil constriction response to increasing illumination levels (merely reflecting parasympathetic activation), whereas the pupil dilation response, which is the response of interest in the current study, reflects sympathetic activation and parasympathetic inhibition.  In light of these different mechanisms, I wonder whether it is correct to assume that the selected illumination level was indeed the one allowing the largest pupil dilation responses. Also, early studies on the pupil dilation response have suggested that the pupil dilation response is relatively independent on the baseline pupil size as long as those illumination levels / baseline pupil sizes are not extreme. Please discuss.

_While it is true that the iris sphincter and iris dilator muscles are separately innervated, there is some suggestion in the literature that the magnitude of the (sympathetic) pupillary response to effort or load is moderated by the resting (baseline) dilation, and that this effect is most noticeable at the extremes of pupil dilation/constriction. Therefore, we used the steepness of the (parasympathetic) light reflex response as a means of determining a per-subject mid-range pupil size where such mediating effects are less likely to occur. Incidentally, we are unaware of any literature on the mechanism of this mediation (though we speculate that it could arise from mechanical constraints on the tissues), and we consider it to be not very well established (but prefer to be cautious in case it is in fact true). We have added text around lines XXX to XXX to address this._

The inter-stimulus interval was randomly distributed between 3 and 5 seconds. However, 3 seconds after stimulus onset, the pupil size does not seem to be back around baseline levels. This may have influenced the next pupil dilation response. Please report how many epochs were excluded based on the 2.5 sec criterion (page 6, line 88). I assume these epochs mainly included those trials with a 3-sec ISI?

_Information about number of excluded epochs has been added to the manuscript; generally speaking, the bulk of exclusions were indeed due to the 2.5 second criterion (which, as you seem to have guessed, was included so as to minimize lingering effects of a preceding button press on the subsequent trial's baseline)._

Please indicate whether Hoeks and Levelt, and Wierda et al. used the same or similar stimuli and procedures, or whether differences in the type or duration of the stimuli may have influenced the different values of tmax.

_These details have been added. Notably, we used virtually identical stimuli to those used by Hoeks and Levelt in their auditory task (they also had a visual task, and their estimate of t_max is based on the combination of these, but --- crucially --- in both modalities they only analyzed trials with button-press responses)._

Why does the value of tmax determined in the current study also relate to a pupil response to continuous auditory stimuli (line 105)?

_This follows from the assumption of the pupillary response as a linear time-invariant system._

## Figure 3
The authors also discuss the z-score normalized pupil size in relation to this Figure. Please present these data as well in the same or an additional figure. The reader may confuse the abbreviation AU with the stimulus cues.

## Abstract
please explain the mathematical formula (e.g. latency of response maximum).

_Done, thank you for pointing out that omission._

## Page 5, lines 81-83
Please confirm that the data of these subjects were indeed similar to those of the other subjects.

_Done._


## Line 107
please indicate that this was not the case in the current study.

_This **was** in fact the case in our Experiment 2, where targets were balanced across experimental conditions as well as across the four possible letter locations. The fact that deconvolution using our estimate of t_max yields apparently meaningful information about timing suggests that this assertion is correct (i.e., it is possible to treat pupillary responses to button presses as noise, if properly counterbalanced)._

# Reviewer 2

## Points to be clarified
The motivation for conducting a deconvolution analysis of pupillometry. For example (as I understand it), this approach is particularly useful for analyzing rapid event-related designs in which the pupil responses summate across trials. Though alluded to, this wasn't explicitly stated in the Introduction.

_XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX_

The extent to which the new tmax parameter is appropriate for deconvolution analyses across different tasks. It seemed that a goal of this study was to derive a purer measure of the canonical pupil response function (akin to the double gamma function in BOLD imaging) by eliminating variance due to responding from previous estimates. In lines 103-108, the authors do say that tmax could be used in other auditory tasks. However, they may wish to further strengthen this statement by noting if the updated response function is expected to be appropriate not only in studies with any response types (e.g., button press, oral, none) but also modality (e.g., auditory, visual, following Hoeks & Levelt).

In this same section, the authors state that the updated tmax could be used in studies with button presses if balanced across conditions. However, rather than treating presses as noise, is it possible/preferable to treat the onset time of each response as another impulse-generating event?

The use of 100 ms kernel spacing in Experiment 2. I thought Wierda et al. used this interval because it corresponded to the onset of each stimulus, which is not the case in the current experiment.

In Figure 3, the dashed horizontal lines indicating the different task epochs would be clearer if depicted using the same schematic as in Figure 2 (i.e., a joined line that diverges, or else make Figure 2 align with Figure 3's depiction).
