# Templates and filters

There are three pandoc `.tex` templates here, for the three different versions of the article generated by `../Makefile`.  Besides that, `latex-make-standalone.py` takes a formatted `bbl` file and inserts it into the main `.tex` document to create a single source document compilable without BibTeX (as JASA requires).  `latex-postprocessor.py` basically exists to convert non-ASCII glyphs in the markdown source into LaTeX-friendly equivalents prior to compiling with `pdflatex`, or to swap out image extensions (JASA submission requires EPS figures, `xelatex` works better with PDF figures).
