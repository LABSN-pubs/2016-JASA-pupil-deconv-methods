# WIP JASA-EL article
This repo is for a methods paper on deconvolution of pupillometry data for auditory experiments. The makefile accepts directives `pre` (for prepress version formatted similar to the final formatting in JASA-EL) or `sub` (for the JASA-EL submittable version: with double spacing, line numbers, list of figures, etc).  

**WARNING:** Figure generation is not 100% automated, because it requires opening the auto-generated PDF figures in Adobe Illustrator and saving them as EPS files in order to avoid rasterization of the semi-transparent regions of the plot.  Running `make clean` will remove all figures _**including the EPS files**_, which will require you to then run `make pre` to generate the PDF figures, open each in Illustrator and re-save as EPS, prior to being able to run `make sub` successfully.
